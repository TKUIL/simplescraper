# simplescraper
Simple python-based web scraper for population data from worldometers.info and simple visualization with pandas and matplotlib.
The run_scraper.bat file will run the application and populate a .csv file with the scraped data.

If you wish to build the application and run it from an IDE try setup.bat. 
REVIEW the contents of the .bat files before running anything.
Also exports the scraped data into a .csv file that can be further used to make PowerBI reports. Below are examples of PowerBI reporting.
